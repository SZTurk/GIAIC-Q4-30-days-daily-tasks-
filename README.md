GIAIC daily task of  Friday class by Sir Hamza Syed made by Asma Khan     

1. Nine Pillars Understanding
a) Why is using AI Development Agents for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

Because it removes low-level, repetitive work and lets you spend more time on high-level design. This builds architectural thinking, improves system planning skills, and helps you focus on decisions that actually shape the system.

b) How do the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer?

They combine AI tools, specs, testing, automation, and agents to support work across multiple domains. This allows the developer to gain deep skill in several areas simultaneously, creating the broad and multi-specialized profile of an M-Shaped Developer.

2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
a) Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

Because it lacks structure. Over time the code becomes inconsistent, hard to maintain, and difficult to extend, as there is no documented plan guiding decisions.

b) How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

SDD provides clear written requirements before coding begins, ensuring the system stays consistent, predictable, and aligned with the intended design. This reduces confusion and prevents long-term technical debt.

3. Architecture Thinking
a) How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

It shifts the developer’s role from primarily writing code to designing the system’s structure, workflows, and boundaries. The developer becomes a planner and orchestrator rather than a code producer.

b) Why must developers think in layers and systems instead of raw code?

Because layered thinking ensures scalability, clarity, and maintainability. It allows AI agents and humans to understand the system as a whole, preventing the disorganized code that results from focusing only on individual files.
